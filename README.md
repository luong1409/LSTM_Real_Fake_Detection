# LSTM for Real & Fake News Detection
## Objective
I create this repo for practice a little bit about how to use LSTM for some specific task (i.e Text Analysis).<br>
While coding I have learnt many new things (like how LSTM work, what is Bidirectional LSTM, what is output of LSTM, etc).

---
## Outcome
- I could understand clearly how LSTM work, how it could perform such a task like Text analysis.<br>
- Get to know how to use framework like `torchtext` for perform task that related to NLP field.
- Hand on the text preprocessing progress, that make me have a better view about how all task in NLP could be done.

---
## Folders and Files
- `code.ipynb`: this notebook file includes all draft code that I writes for getting my hand dirty with LSTM model.
- `news.csv`: this .csv file is the raw dataset.
- folder `data`: this folder will include **train**, **test**, **valid** set that have been preprocessed and splitted from our raw dataset.
- folder `models`: folder for saving checkpoints and metrics from our training process.

## How to run this repo
You could run from notebook file:
```
code.ipynb
```
<!-- <br> -->
Or you could run using command line:
```
$ python main.py
```
